Install AwayExtensions3dsmax.


- Run the setup file for your 3dsmax version (e.g.  setup_2014_x64.cmd)

- Follow the Insturctions in the commandline.

- Once Installation is finsihed, 3dsmax should automaticly start.

- In 3dsmax make shure to load the AWDToolBar 

	go to "Customize"->"Custoomize User Interface"-Tab:"ToolBars"

	load the AWDToolBar file for your 3dsmax Version (e.g. AWDToolbar_2013_2014.cuix)




Trouble-shooting:

- 	if the installer doesnt run correctly, you can try to run it as admin. (right mousclick on the file and "run as admin")

-	if the installer still fails, your 3dsmax installation might be customized, so the setup does not find all required 3dsmax pathes on your system.
	all the pathes are defined in line 9 - line 27 in the setup file 
	you can open the setup file in any texteditor, and modify it to be compatible with your system.
